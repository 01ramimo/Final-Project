# Final-Project

### Assessment

My role within the team for our project “Animal Shelter Solutions with Machine Learning” was setting up the database (set up and integration).  I supported the team and other roles by attending all discussions and I asked questions when needed for clarification or to stimulate further conversation. The biggest personal challenge encountered during the project was time management and coordination of team members’ schedules.

Our project communication protocol was primarily email, Slack, and Zoom Calls (on all school days and weekends and during project class time).  One challenge was trying to nail down cohesively the various ideas and opinions of team members so that we could all be on the same page. Next time, a good idea would also be to get all team members’ schedules and availability for calls/meetings established at the beginning of the project rather than ad hoc. The strength of the team was communication, collaboration, and support as well as flexibility with ideas and availability. Everyone’s willingness to help each other was also an added benefit as our personalities meshed well together for the common goal. A tip for others is just to be open-minded and give everyone a chance to express their ideas and opinions.

For LinkedIn profile, in an interview or cover letter, or as an elevator pitch, I would state the following: 
Co-Contributor to the project “Animal Shelter Solutions with Machine Learning” utilizing the Naïve Bayes (Bernoulli) model. Contributed to database set-up and design and output analysis and metrics. The final output displayed various parameters of canines (breed, age, sex, size, color, etc.) and how this information could be utilized to analyze the length of stay in the kennel based on such attributes/characteristics.
